I love javascript. It's less about maitaining a database and more about ... well everything else PLUS managing a database. I could get lost in the oossibilities. Yeah it may not be a number cruncher but I can build things that feel intuitive. I like visual as much as I like number crunching. Working with javascript took a bit to switch my mind to from rails. Rails takes convention over everything to the point that it's almast fomulaic. But my imagination gets let loose in Javascript.  Based on the feedback I got about my Rails project I decided to build my project one step at a time. BUilding methods only when I needed them instaed of dreaming up my app on paper and then writing a bunch of code that I may not end up needing. THis time I think the opposite happened. What I thought would be a short walk in the park ended up have many more steps. Wish I could spend another month on this project. There are so many things I worked on that I ultimately couldn't finish due to lack of knoweledge and experience but I'm proud of it. My kids love it.
