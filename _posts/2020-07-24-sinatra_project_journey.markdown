      All I can say is wow. That is why I love programming. The problem solving is why I get up in the morning. With this project, like the one berfore it, I went a step or two beyond the scope of the assignment. Instead on of making an app that keeps track of personal things, I made a program that allows customers to request info from a ficticious landscape company. The customers "enquire" about services and the employees can read and respond to them. I tried to be as secure as possibe. Customers could ony see their info. Employees could see their info plus the customers info and the boss "Bubba" see all data and was the only one who could make new employee entries. This was a ton of fun. The hardest part was the css element sizing and positioning can be tedious and I'm not great at it by any stretch of the imagination but I'm A LOT better than I was before this project. I even learned there are websites that can analyze an image and return a color palette from it complete with hexadecimal numbers.
