Hi I just finished my first project for Flatiron. It's a CLI application that scrapes data from brainyquotes.com so that you can search and view quotes by author or topic. It also has a random author generator that you can choose  quotes from a randomized list of authors. There's also one for topics. It's a fairly complete program . 

Creating the application was a doozy. I was giong to make one using a list of super heroes that can be accessed based on powers, teams and such but the websites for that information were sktchy at best. Even on Marvel and DC coporate sites. So I found this site thinking about how I love the wisdom of philosophers. So I came to this site. I was immediatley challenged. The tutorials on how to use Nokogiri were all about navigating through DIVs but I was at once trying to parse a table on the website. After that I realized my project was a bit ambitious. As usual for me. I worked almost non stop for 6 days to complete it. Although it would have been shorter if not for my error of deleting my Git repository on the 5th night. I was coding while exhausted and thought I was only deleting a commit. Luckily I had most of my code on some word files.  But that created another problem. Evidently copying and pasting from word files to the Learn.co IDE causes problems with the code. My code was much more elegant before the crash but I needed to get it working and done. I did and that's why I'm here. It was a learning experience and I'm proud of my determination to see this through even if I know the final product was better on a earlier version. I learned so much and I'll never ever delete another Git Repository for as long as I live. But hey never say never.
